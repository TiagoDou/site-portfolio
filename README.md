# site-portfolio
 this is my personal portfolio, i created it for a project during my first semester in college for a web dev class.
 my plan for this is to keep the portfolio updated constantly, adding new things as my skills advance and changing old ones when i learn a better way to do so.

 since this is my first porfolio i took heavy inspiration from [Matt Farley's website](https://mattfarley.ca/)
 i used the same CSS lib as the site mentioned since im not that good with CSS yet. (yet tho!)
 even tho i used the same lib, i actually took some time to understand it a bit and mess arround with it.

 i made the site in a pretty crude way, it is lacking a lot of stuff, but as i said, this is just the start of it.

 here is a direct link to the site, along with some screenshots of the first version that i published:
